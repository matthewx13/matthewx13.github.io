    <p> Hello! I am Matthew Xue and I am a senior at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Business Admin. I was born in Houston, Texas and my favorite ice cream is coffee and pecan ice cream from Cold Stone. This website will be a personal website that will be used to introduce myself to potential employers. In the near future I would like to add these things to my website: </p> 
    <ul> 
         <li>A page that includes my resume </li>
         <li>Experiences</li>
         <li>A page that displays my projects</li>
         <li>A page that includes fun facts about me </li>
         <li>Cool interactive functions as I learn more about web development </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Thank you for visiting my first website!</p>
